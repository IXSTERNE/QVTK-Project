# Book Store/Library Stock Management System???

School project using PyQt5 and VTK


## Can't add a license because following reasons :
    1. PyQT5 GPL 
    2. Fonts unless the ones I used don't have any?
    3. STL models and textures until I add my own blender models

Added a README.md just to track PyLint errors
